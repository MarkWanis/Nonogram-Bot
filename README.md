This project is a Python program that automatically solves nonogram puzzles and visually displays the solving process using Pygame. It initializes a grid based on given row and column clues, then repeatedly evaluates each row and column to determine which cells must be filled or empty. The solver works by generating all valid line combinations that match the given clues and comparing them to find which cells are always filled or always blank across all possibilities. These consistent cells are then updated on the grid, and the display refreshes to show progress step by step. The main loop continues running until no further changes occur or the puzzle is complete. The program uses functions for drawing the puzzle, handling the grid layout, evaluating lines, finding consistent cells, and updating the display. It applies logical deduction rather than random guessing, making it a straightforward example of constraint-based problem solving.
